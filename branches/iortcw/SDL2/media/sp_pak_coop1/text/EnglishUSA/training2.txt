Exercise 2: Opening Doors

The following exercise will teach you how to open doors.

Instructions:

Open the following set of doors in front of you. By pressing your 'activate' key the door will open and you will be allowed entry. 

The 'hand' icon, which appears at the bottom of your display, will notify you when a door, gate or portcullis may be entered.

You may also choose to open a rotating door with a swift boot kick. While standing directly in front of the door, press your 'kick' key. Kicking a door will cause it to open faster.

When you feel comfortable with your ability to open doors using the two methods described above, proceed to the next station.

Time Limit: None
