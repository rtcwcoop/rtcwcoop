^0Part 1: Bramburg Dam^0

The mission to the "X-Labs" had the effect of driving Deathshead into hiding; at this time his whereabouts are unknown.  However, it is now known that he was only a supporting character in Himmler's ultimate goal; to resurrect Heinrich I.  It appears that three of Deathshead's Super Soldiers will be "anointed" by Marianna Blavatsky in a ceremony to be held near Chateau Shufstaffel in the village of Paderborn.  They will then be brought to the grave of Heinrich I located near Castle Wolfenstein for the "Resurrection".  While many in the OSA remain skeptical of this ceremony, recent events have shown that nothing can be ruled out.
  
Your mission is to infiltrate Chateau Shufstaffel and stop this ceremony at all costs.  To reduce the chances of alerting the enemy, you will be air dropped near a dam two kilometers from Paderborn. You must cross the dam to reach Paderborn, and from there gain access to the chateau.  A silent approach is your best option.  Once in Paderborn you are to assassinate the Paranormal Division officers and discover the exact location of the ceremonies. Should you arrive too late, proceed with all speed to Castle Wolfenstein and ensure the "Resurrection" does not take place.
