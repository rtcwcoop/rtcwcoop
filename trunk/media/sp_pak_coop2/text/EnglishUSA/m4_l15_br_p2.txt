The second part of the SWF industrial complex is the Train yards/Freight Depot.  Aerial Recon reports that this area appears to have been less damaged than the factory.  The real strategic importance of this area is that it is the only entrance into the Secret Weapons Facility itself, which lies underground and out of reach of Allied bombers.  

Unfortunately, our tactical knowledge of this area is minimal at best, so you must discover on your own which building contains the SWF entrance.
