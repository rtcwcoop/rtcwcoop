               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase II: Creation

45 days total.  Results are to be 
published immediately thereafter.







The recent discovery of new Meteorillium
317 deposits in our Baltic territories has
now enabled us to meet our original
production targets (see note)

 Note: Meteorillium 317, the rarest form
 of Meteorillium, is found only in certain
 meteor fragments that are believed to
 have originated at the core of our galaxy.
 It is essential in the manufacture of the
 Imbuement Vessel, the key component of the
 Live Essence Annointment Ritual.
