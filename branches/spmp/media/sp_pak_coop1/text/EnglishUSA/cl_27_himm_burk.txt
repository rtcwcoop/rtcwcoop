To:  General Burkhalter 
From: Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler

Congratulations on being selected as a Meta-Psychic Controller.  It is a great honor but also a great responsibility.  Only you and your colleagues, by exercising the necessary controls, can guarantee success and prevent utter chaos.  I direct you to weigh the matter heavily.  I also direct you to put aside any petty differences.  I know your feelings about Madame Blavatsky; but understand that, despite your objections, she is in charge of the ceremony.  She has my complete confidence and I expect you to obey her orders as you would my own.

Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer SS
