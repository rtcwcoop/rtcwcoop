               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Appendix

His unlikely opponent was the enigmatic Simon the Wanderer.  A former Benedictine monk, Simon left the order to form his own mysterious sect.  With his chosen followers he traveled incessantly throughout Europe, Asia Minor, and The Far East, collecting countless items of mystical knowledge from all the ancient cultures of The Old World.  No doubt the channeling of raw fundamental, destructive forces as practiced by Heinrich would have seemed an anathema to someone of Simon's reflective and meditative nature.

The confrontation occurred - so the legend says - in 943.  After a prolonged, cataclysmic struggle, Simon and his followers, by means never revealed, managed to neutralize and slay the Dark Knights.  Their remains were entombed in undisclosed locations, painstakingly sealed against future violation.
