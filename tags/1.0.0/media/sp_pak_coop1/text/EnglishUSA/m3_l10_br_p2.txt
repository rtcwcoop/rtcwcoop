^0Part 2: Rocket Base^0

German resistance informs us that the rocket Deathshead intends to fire at London carries some kind of new chemical warhead, the total destructiveness of which is currently unknown.

German resistance also informs us that all of these rockets have a "self-destruct" switch, usually located in the main rocket control room.  Unfortunately, we know virtually nothing of the interior layout of the base.  It will be up to you to determine the best means of reaching the main control room so that you can destroy the rocket before it reaches London.  

After destroying the rocket it is likely that the base will be on full alert.  Use all means available to exit the base and proceed to the outer compound.
