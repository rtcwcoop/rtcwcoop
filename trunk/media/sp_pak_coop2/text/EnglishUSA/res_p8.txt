               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase III:  Resurrection

Officer in charge:  SS Oberfuhrer,
High Priestess Adept Marianna Blavatsky



Background - This final phase represents
the culmination of over ten years of
arduous work and painstaking research.  It
is the realization of a dream that began
even earlier.   All of our efforts thus
far were to achieve this one end: The
resurrection of Heinrich I, Master of the
Dark Hosts, Wielder of the powers of Earth
and Fire, and spiritual ancestor of our
glorious Reichsfuhrer SS.
