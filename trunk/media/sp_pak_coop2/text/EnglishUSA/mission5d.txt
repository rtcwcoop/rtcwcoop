Airdropped in occupied Norway near X-Labs.  Encountered U-Boat which was seen leaving SWF.  Medium resistance encountered along approach to X-Labs entrance.  Necessary to blow through security doors, signaling my arrival to X-Labs security forces.  Encountered more "Lopers" inside facility, as well as a new class of "X-Creature" termed "Proto-Soldier".  Seven feet tall, heavily armored and very irritable, these creatures required a serious amount of firepower to bring down.  Located Deathshead's inner sanctum where I was introduced to what he called ".the pinnacle of his research".  This was the Super Soldier, a much more robust variant of the Proto-Soldier.  After considerable effort the Super Soldier was defeated, but Deathshead managed to escape.
