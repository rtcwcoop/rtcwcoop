^0Part 1: Bramburg Dam^0

The mission to the "X-Labs" had the effect of driving Deathshead into hiding; at this time his whereabouts are unknown.  However, it is now known that he was only a supporting character in Himmler's ultimate goal; to resurrect Heinrich I.  It appears that three of Deathshead's Super Soldiers will be "anointed" by Marianna Blavatsky in a ceremony to be held near Chateau Shufstaffel in the village of Paderborn.  They will then be brought to the grave of Heinrich I located near Castle Wolfenstein for the "Resurrection".  While many in the OSA remain skeptical of this ceremony, recent events have shown that nothing can be ruled out.
