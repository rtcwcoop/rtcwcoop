               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase III:  Resurrection

The ceremony is to take place at our
holiest site during the most favorable
alignment of Saturn and Mars.

A minimum of three Hosts shall be prepared
as described in the ancient texts (see
note).

 Note - For the sake of redundancy, six
 was agreed upon as the optimal number of
 hosts.

The presiding Mystic Adept, Madame
Blavatsky, shall open the ceremony with 
an encantation as the Life Essence Elixer
is absorbed into the bodies of the 
initiates.  Shortly thereafter she shall 
utter the 'Annointment Invocation', 
imbueing each host in its turn with 
the Dark Life Essence.
