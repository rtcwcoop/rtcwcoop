To: Secretary Giereg
From: Major Jurgen

I am well aware of Reichsmarshall Directive 197, however I admit to being at a complete loss as to why you should consider it necessary to remind me of it.  We have always been operating within full compliance of the law and all such items not deemed essential to the current project have been swiftly forwarded to the Reichsmarshall's office.  Let me assure you that absolutely nothing has been withheld and that no hoarding of any kind has been taking place here.

Regards,
Major Wilhelm Jurgen
Security Officer, Castle Wolfenstein
