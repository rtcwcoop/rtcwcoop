My Dear Willy,
My compliments on the amazing work achieved by your Advanced "V" Weapons Division.  Clearly, the success of this project has exceeded all expectations.  Also, I've just read the latest test reports on the "Kobra" rocket plane.  Suffice to say, I couldn't be more pleased with the results.

Unfortunately, I am not nearly as pleased with your performance on another project.  Make no mistake; OPERATION RESURRECTION is currently the Reich's single most important undertaking.  This is especially true following the Extraction Team's successfully recovery of the third Dark Knight.  I expect no less than a maximum effort from you at all times.  I sincerely hope it will never become necessary for me to remind you of this again.

Yours fondly
H. Himmler
