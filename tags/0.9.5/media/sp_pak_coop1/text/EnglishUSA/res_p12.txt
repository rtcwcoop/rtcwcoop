               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Appendix

Armed with this great power, Heinrich set about raising an army such as the world had never seen, an army of the undead.  At the core of Heinrich's army were his three most trusted vassals, the legendary Dark Knights.  In exchange for their loyalty, Heinrich imbued his Dark Knights with enormous power by means of an obscure Thulian ritual.  Through this ritual, Heinrich and his companions became, themselves, living conduits of the dark forces, masters of the nether regions between life and death.

In 933 Heinrich unleashed his irresistible army against the invading Magyars, inflicting a crushing defeat upon them at Riade.  Next he turned his eyes west, intent upon overthrowing his Frankish overlords.  It is difficult to imagine what the extent of his conquests might have been were it not for one fateful encounter.
