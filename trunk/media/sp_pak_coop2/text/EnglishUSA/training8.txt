Exercise 8: Safety Cages

This station will teach you the importance of safety cages and how to effectively use them during the descent of a ladder.

Instructions:

Ascend and descend this obstacle using the climbing skills you have learned previously. 

When you feel comfortable with your ability, try negotiating the obstacle at an accelerated pace. You'll notice that when you are not facing a ladder you will release your grip on the rungs and fall towards the ground. The safety cage will allow you enough time to turn and face the ladder while you begin to fall. You can use this tactic to your advantage during a confrontation with the enemy.

When you are finished and feel comfortable with your ability, proceed to the next station.

Time Limit: None
