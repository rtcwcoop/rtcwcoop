^0Part 4:  The Defiled Church^0

Residents of Wulfburg call this "The Defiled Church". It apparently has a rather sordid history dating back 1000 years.  Over the ages it has been rumored to have been used for a number of occult ceremonies.  Rumors aside, we do know that Helga von Bulow and her SS Paranormal Division team are there now.  We do not know what they are planning, so it is imperative that you investigate and recover as much intelligence information as possible.

A word of caution; the Kreisau Circle has reported that Helga von Bulow's "Elite Guard" is made up of a small group of extremely capable women who have been trained to an exceptionally high level, both physically and with small arms.  They are also reportedly bound together as part of a witch's coven.
