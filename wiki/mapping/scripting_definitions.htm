<h3>wait &lt;duration&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will tell the SCRIPT_MOVER to not move for the duration.
</p>

<h3>trigger &lt;aiName/scriptName&gt; &lt;trigger&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will call/trigger an AI or Script_mover to run it's &quot;trigger &lt;event&gt;&quot;
</p>

<h3>playsound &lt;soundname OR scriptname&gt; [LOOPING]</h3>
<p>
  This will play a sound.wav or a script name in one of the .sounds files. LOOPING will loop the sound until 
  &quot;STOPSOUND&quot; is used.
</p>

<h3>playanim &lt;startframe&gt; &lt;endframe&gt; [looping forever/duration] [rate FPS]</h3>
<p>
  This will play an animation that the model has. STARTFRAME is the frame number you want to start on. ENDFRAME 
  is the last frame number you want to play. LOOP FOREVER/DURATION is used if you want the animation to loop 
  forever, or for a duration. RATE is used so that you can slow down the FPS.
</p>

<h3>alertentity &lt;targetname&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will trigger/activate certain entities in the map. Usually just TARGET_RELAYS.
</p>

<h3>accum &lt;buffer_index&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;paramater&gt;</h3>
<p>
  Accum is used for &quot;what if&quot; statements. Accums store integers which are used to  trigger scripts.
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; inc &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This is used to &quot;increase&quot;/add to value already stored in the accum. </p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; abort_if_less_than &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This is used to abort the script if the value of accum &lt;n&gt; is less than &lt;m&gt;.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; abort_if_greater_than &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This is used to abort the script if the value of accum &lt;n&gt; is greater than &lt;m&gt;.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; set &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This is used to set the value of accum &lt;n&gt; to &lt;m&gt;.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; bitset &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This will set accum n's bitset of 0-31 to ON or 1, whichever you prefer.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; bitreset &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This will set accum n's biteset of 0-31 to OFF or 0, whichever you prefer.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; abort_if_bitset &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This will abort if the bitset is ON or 1. So, the bitset needs to be OFF or 0.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; abort_if_not_bitset &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This will abort if the bitset is OFF or 0. So, the bitset needs to be ON or 1.</p>
  <h3>accum &lt;n&gt; random &lt;m&gt;</h3>
    <p>This is used so that accum &lt;n&gt; will randomly choose a number.</p>
</p>

<h3>missionfailed</h3>
<p>
  This is used to fail the PLAYER from completing his mission objectives.
</p>

<h3>missionsuccess &lt;mission_level&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This is used to tell the PLAYER he/she has completed the mission.
</p>

<h3>print &lt;text&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will PRINT text up on the screen/console.
</p>

<h3>faceangles &lt;pitch&gt; &lt;yaw&gt; &lt;roll&gt; &lt;duration/GOTOTIME&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will tell the SCRIPT_MOVER to rotate. DURATION/GOTOTIME, Duration will determine how long 
  it takes the SCRIPT_MOVER to get to the ANGLES you inputed. GOTOTIME will calculate the time it 
  takes for the SCRIPT_MOVER to reach it's target (PATH_CORNER).
</p>

<h3>resetscript</h3>
<p>
  This will tell the AI to FORGET everything he is doing and everything he has done and either 
  continue the script or go into dynamic mode.
</p>

<h3>attachtotag &lt;targetname/scriptname&gt; &lt;tagname&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This will attach this SCRIPT_MOVER to the TAG on another SCRIPT_MOVER. NOTE: The SCRIPT_MOVER 
  you will attach to must havea  TAG with a TAGNAME. The modeller (Jason) will do this for you.
</p>

<h3>stopsound</h3>
<p>
  This will stop the sound the SCRIPT_MOVER is playing.
</p>

<h3>halt</h3>
<p>
  This will stop the SCRIPT_MOVER in it's tracks.
</p>

<h3>backupscript</h3>
<p>
  This will backup the last script running for the script_mover.
</p>

<h3>restorescript</h3>
<p>
  This will restore the last script the script_mover was running. Must have backupscript before 
  restorescript can function.
</p>

<h3>sethealth &lt;n&gt;</h3>
<p>
  This resets the health of the script_mover to &lt;n&gt;.
