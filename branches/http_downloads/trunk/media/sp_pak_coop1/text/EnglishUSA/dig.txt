^0Part 1: The Dig^0

We have virtually no information for you at this time regarding your mission.  You are in uncharted territory, so it will be up to you to determine the best possible course of action.
If you were unable to disrupt the ceremony and prevent the Super Soldiers from being transformed into "Dark Knights", then you will ultimately have to stop Blavatsky and the resurrection ritual.  How you accomplish this task must be left up to you.

The fate of the free world now rests on your shoulders Agent Blazkowicz.  Failure is not an option.
