Exercise 11: Swimming

This exercise will teach you how to swim.

Instructions:

Enter the water and follow the striped tile markings until you reach the far end of the pool. 

Your normal movement keys will work in the same manner under water as above water. However, beneath the surface you will only have a limited amount of time before you run out of air. Be careful to watch your health meter. Use the ladder on the opposite side of the pool to exit the water.

Once you have completed this exercise, enter the adjoining building.
