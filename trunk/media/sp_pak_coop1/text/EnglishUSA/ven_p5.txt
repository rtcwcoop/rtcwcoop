
cartridge case, resulting in massive stoppage. As the feeder/delinker components were encased in a solid outer housing, only by removing the feeder/delinker system from the gun and disassembling it, using a pry bar to force the gears around, could clear the stoppage. This was a major project that took at least 20 minutes.

To alleviate the situation we have installed a hinged hatch on the feeder/delinker housing for easier access. Since it's a two piece unit, the hatch also permits placing the belt by hand into the proper position for firing, just like a standard belt fed machine gun's top cover (in fact, the hinged locking latch on the hatch was taken directly from the American's .50 caliber Browning machine gun's top cover).  

Final Analysis:

We have recently completed 3 separate 100,000 round tests with the improved GP-VG MK2 Venom Gun. The results were phenomenal. There was only one stoppage, which was cleared in a matter of seconds. As directed, the Venom Gun is ready for deployment and is the most precisely directed and most devastating small arm weapon currently available anywhere in the world.
