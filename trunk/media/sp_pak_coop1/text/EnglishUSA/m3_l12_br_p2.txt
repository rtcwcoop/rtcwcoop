^0Part 4: Air Base Assault^0

Enter the experimental aircraft test facility via the outer compound of the rocket base.  The airbase houses the latest Bachem Ba317 "Kobra" experimental rocket plane in a hangar at the northern perimeter.  Upon infiltration of the airbase, eliminate any resistance and proceed to the "Kobra" launch hangar.

You will need to prep the "Kobra" for launch, so look for launch procedure documentation in the facility.  Once you have appropriated the "Kobra" and are airborne, proceed immediately back to the OSA airbase in Malta.  The Ba317 is reported to travel at speeds in excess of 500 knots, so enemy air defenses should offer no problem.  Contact OSA immediately upon touchdown in Malta for debriefing and further orders.

Good luck.
