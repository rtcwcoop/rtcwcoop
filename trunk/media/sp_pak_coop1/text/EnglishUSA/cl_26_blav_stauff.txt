My Dear General
I was overjoyed to hear that you were one of the chosen few.  I can think of no one more deserving of that honor.  On the other hand, I was totally dejected when I learned Burkhalter was also chosen.  I know you think the world of him, but I absolutely detest him and his arrogance.  Still I must give the devil his due.  He has the talent and, for the purpose of maintaining the meta-psychic link, that is paramount.  At least there will be one friend present whose support I can count on.
