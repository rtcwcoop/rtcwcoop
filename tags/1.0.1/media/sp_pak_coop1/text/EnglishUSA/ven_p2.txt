Operational Specifics:

The GP-VG MK2 Venom Gun is electrically operated and utilizes a locking-breech system with six barrels and six bolts. The barrels rotate counter clockwise and fire in turn when they reach the 12' o-clock position. The breech mechanism features a rotating bolt head with two locking surfaces (similar to MG34 GPMG).

The bolt subassembly features a helical tang on the bolt head which mates with a helical groove on bolt body. Rotation into the battery is clockwise with the bolt rotating around the firing pin holding entire bolt assembly together.

The bolt head itself locks into recesses in the rotor (the main structural component of the gun) while the barrel interfaces with the front of the rotor. A roller on top of the bolt subassembly, moving in an elliptical cam path in the receiver housing, drives the bolt forward.
