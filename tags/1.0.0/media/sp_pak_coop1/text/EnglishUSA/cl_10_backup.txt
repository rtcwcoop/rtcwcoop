To: All Control Room Watch Commanders
From: Oberst Steiner
Subject: Backup Launch Tower Operator

Due to the failure of our maintenance department to successfully resolve the reliability issues, which continue to plague the Remote Tower Door Actuator, it will still be necessary to employ a Backup Launch Tower Operator during all launch operations.

To prevent a repeat of last weeks unfortunate incident, I am issuing the following standing order: The Backup Launch Tower Operator shall - at all times - carry a functioning communications set and shall not - under any circumstances - leave the vicinity of the Tower Door Manual Override.  Hopefully, this situation will be corrected shortly and will not prove to be beyond the capabilities of our existing maintenance personnel.

Commanding Officer, Reich Special Projects, NW District
