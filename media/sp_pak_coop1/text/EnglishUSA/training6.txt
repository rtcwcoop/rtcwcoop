Exercise 6: Medical Kits

This is an introduction to first aid.

Instructions:

Sitting on the table beside you are three large medical kits. If you are in need of healing you will automatically pick them up as you move toward them.

You may also choose to pick up a medical kit by pressing the 'activate' key. When you are close enough to pick up the item it will become highlighted signifying it is ready for use. 

If you prefer this method, you may turn off the 'auto pick-up' option in your control settings. However, in doing so, you will need to manually pick up all items in the game, including weapons and ammunition.

Once you are at full health, proceed to the next station.

Time Limit: None
