To:   SS-Oberfuhrer Wilhelm (Deathshead) Strasse
From: Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler

Willy,
It saddens me to hear that you have declined the invitation from the Paranormal Division to attend the upcoming ceremony in Paderborn. You will be missing out on a rare opportunity to witness a momentous event.  I had hoped this experience might provide you with new insight or, at the very least, cure your lingering skepticism.  I see that, once again, I am to be disappointed.

I have always considered you one the most valuable contributors to the Reich.  Were it not for your continued obstinacy in this area, there would be no limit to the support I would give you.  I urge you to reconsider.  It is not too late.

H. Himmler
