Dear Madame Blavatsky,
All the early indications are positive.  The talismanic seals and bindings are identical to those found in the Dark Knight tomb at Holstein.  If I were to venture a guess at this juncture it would be that we have definitely uncovered number three.  Finally, after all these years, we may be very close to concluding phase one.

Conditions here are far less than favorable.  Already we have lost precious hours to technical mishaps.  It's going to be difficult meeting our timetable while exercising necessary precautions.  I will keep you informed as necessary.

Sincerely,
A. Zemph
