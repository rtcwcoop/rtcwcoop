To:  General Haupfman 
From: SS-Oberfuhrer Wilhelm Strasse

I'm sorry, old friend, but my decision not to attend the ceremony must stand.  This is especially true in light of recent catastrophic events.  I know you and I have never seen eye to eye on this subject, but that does not stop me from wishing you much success.  They tell me you were chosen to help establish a "psychic control" over the situation.  I'm not sure I fully understand what that means, but I'm relieved to hear that at least one rational mind will be present to maintain order.

Sincerely,
Wilhelm
