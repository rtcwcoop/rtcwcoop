Phase I:  Extraction

Following a successful extraction, all
materials are to be delivered to the 
nearest field lab for further processing.

Once processing is completed, the
resulting distillate compound will be
sent to SS Paranormal headquarters where
it will remain until the completion of
Phase II.
