Subj: Radar Operations Safety Report

An exhaustive study undertaken by the Ministry of Safety's Radiology Department has shown no correlation between moderate doses of microwave radiation and increased incidence of skin and blood disease.  Also, all rumors attributing vomiting, diarrhea, and hair-loss to such exposures have proven to be completely unfounded.

It is the opinion of the ministry that current procedures in effect for radar operators are well within acceptable safety limits.  We do not, at this time, recommend any changes.
