To: Shipping and Receiving
From: Oberst Steiner


The replacement V2 liquid fuel rocket motor is expected to arrive shortly. It is essential for this shipment to be fully staged and delivered to Component Integration immediately upon receipt.  Because of last Thursday's unfortunate incident, time is now extremely critical and delays will no longer be tolerated.
