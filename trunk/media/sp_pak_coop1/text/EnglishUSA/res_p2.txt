               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase I:  Extraction

Excavation shall commence at the first
favorable lunar cycle.  The team - under
the direct supervision of Oberfuhrer von
Bulow - shall, at all times, maintain
strict adherence to established rituals of
talismanic removal and residual purification.


Upon completion of the excavation, the
Extraction Team - headed by Professor
Zemph - shall perform the most delicate
step in the entire procedure - a life
essence disengagement of the heart and all
essential dormant, organic materials.

 Note:  The Reflex Interferomoscope must
 undergo a 36-hour burn in session prior
 to the extraction.
